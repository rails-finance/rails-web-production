// Pure-logic helpers for building Aave V4 spoke selector cards. Adapted from
// rails-explorer's lib/aave/spoke-cards.ts — web-mig only ships aave-v4 (no
// aave-v3 / spark surface yet), so the multi-protocol guard collapses to an
// aave-v4 check, the AaveContext import becomes AaveV4Context, and the event
// type uses BaseActivityEvent's shape.
//
// Crucially, the risk datapoints here (HF, liq price, borrowing power,
// dominant-asset headroom %) derive from the events the API already returns
// plus the static LT lookup table — no on-chain reads are needed. Interest
// carry (computeAaveV4InterestPnl) additionally consumes chain-truth balances.

 * failed → `chainStale`, or the chain fetch was skipped/errored → no
 * chainPosition at all). In that path the only collateral signal is the
 * indexed `collateral_toggle` events that set `collateralEnabled`. Aave V4
 * makes collateral an explicit opt-in that emits a toggle event, so a supplied
 * reserve we never saw an enable-toggle for (`collateralEnabled === undefined`)
 * is resolved to NOT collateral rather than assumed-enabled.
 *
 * This keeps the fallback HF / borrowing-power / liq-price from crediting
 * collateral we can't confirm — the conservative direction for a risk read.
 * Reserves carrying an explicit enable/disable toggle keep that observed value.
 *
 * Only the fallback uses this: when chain truth is available, the patch path
 * overwrites `collateralEnabled` with the on-chain `isCollateral` flag, which
 * is authoritative.
