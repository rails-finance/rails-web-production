// Visibility resolution for the Aave V4 listing — the lifecycle-status axis.
//
// TWO-AXIS MODEL (see rails-ops/reference/events-and-liquidations-across-protocols.md).
// Aave liquidations are PARTIAL and repeatable — a position survives them — so
// "liquidated" is not a lifecycle state a position is *in*; it's something that
// *happened to* it. We therefore split what the old single axis conflated:
//
//   • Status (this file) — a purely STRUCTURAL bucket: open | closed. "Closed"
//     means "no live balance", regardless of how it got there.
//   • Liquidations — an ORTHOGONAL flag ("Liquidated before", the History toggle
//     in list-filter-dimensions) that spans open AND closed. This is the analog
//     of Liquity's Redemptions filter; Aave V4 mirrors Aave V3's model here.
//
// The wire status (AaveV4SpokePositionStatus) still carries a third value,
// 'liquidated', but that is the TERMINAL CAUSE of a closed position (closed *by
// liquidation* vs wound down by the owner) — a refinement the card renders, not a
// filter bucket. `bucketsToWireStatuses` maps the structural "closed" bucket onto
// both wire statuses that mean "no live balance" ('closed' + 'liquidated').
//
// The default in every context — bare directory and scoped wallet query alike —
// is "show everything." That's the self-service-support case: someone looking up
// their own address wants the closed position surfaced, not filtered away.
//
// `statuses` on the filter object carries RAW user intent:
//   - undefined / []  → "no opinion": resolve to the contextual default (the full set)
//   - a concrete set  → an explicit choice
//
// The full-set default is never written into the filter object; it's applied here
// at read time, so a cleared selection always resolves back to "show everything"
// and the full set maps to NO URL `status` param (clean URLs).
