// Chain-truth overrides for Aave V4 spoke card + per-reserve stats
// ============================================================================
//
// The detail page's economics band (tower chart + runway stack + headline
// card) historically derived "current state" from the event-indexed running
// balances in ReserveStats. That math is sound but the inputs aren't — our
// indexer misses events that go through swap-aggregator wrappers, so the
// running balances can drift 10%+ from actual on-chain state. That drift
// flipped one wallet's listing HF from 1.02 (safe) to 0.98 (underwater) in
// the detail UI, contradicting both Aave's site and our own listing page.
//
// This module patches those derived numbers with the gospel-truth state
// fetched from the spoke contract. History-derived fields (peakDebt,
// debtSeries, flowEvents, eventCount) are left intact — they describe what
// happened, not what's true now.

 *  the lifetime breakdown rows. Current state is exposed as `currentSupplied`
 *  / `currentBorrowed`, which consumers should prefer when computing
 *  what's-active-now.
 *
 *  Reserves that exist on chain but not in the event history (e.g. a new
 *  asset the wallet never moved in our indexer) are appended as minimal
 *  rows. Reserves in event history with no chain presence are kept (so
 *  history-only displays still see them) and their current balances are
