// Stub for the Curve event-type union referenced by `learn-more-content.ts`.
//
// rails-web-mig is liquity-only, so the Curve learn-more entries are
// unreachable from the trove detail surface — but the file exports them at
// the module level, so we need to satisfy the type to compile. Promote to a
// real union when Curve content lands in the migration.
