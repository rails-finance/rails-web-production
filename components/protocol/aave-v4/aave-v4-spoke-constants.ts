// Aave V4 spoke metadata used both by the spoke card (heavy component) and by
// the wallet-timeline page header (just two map lookups). Splitting these out
// keeps the wallet-page chunk from pulling in `aave-spoke-card.tsx` and its
// transitive deps just to render a hub label.

// Hub tiers render as neutral text badges (see SpokeIdentity / position card) —
// the tier is identity, not a status, so it carries no color. A former
// `HUB_COLORS` map (per-tier blue/amber/green) was unused and removed to keep
// off-grammar color out of the code; don't reintroduce it. See color-grammar.md.
