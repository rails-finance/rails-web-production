/**
 * Liquidation runway — one shared bar for every rail and every collateral shape
 * (a Liquity V2 trove, an Aave V4 single-asset reserve, an Aave V4 multi-asset
 * basket). It answers "how close is this to liquidation?" at a glance, and the
 * answer reads the same way no matter the protocol or the number of assets.
 *
 * THE UNIFYING IDEA: the bar's horizontal axis *is* the "% from liquidation"
 * metric itself — `m = (value − liq) / value` — not a price window with a number
 * painted on top. That one choice makes the three cases collapse into one:
 *
 *   • Single asset (Liquity trove, Aave single reserve) → value = live price,
 *     liq = liquidation price. `m` is the % the price can fall before liquidation.
 *   • Multi-asset basket (Aave) → value = health factor, liq = HF 1.0. Here
 *     `m = (HF − 1) / HF`, which is the % the collateral basket can fall before
 *     liquidation (HF moves with collateral, so HF→1 happens when collateral has
 *     fallen that much).
 *
 * For a single asset these are *mathematically identical*: `(price − liq)/price`
 * ≡ `(HF − 1)/HF`. So all three are the same risk quantity, and a marker at the
 * same spot means the same risk whether it's one asset or five. The only thing
 * that changes per protocol is the threshold *caption* (a real liquidation price
 * when there's a single asset; `HF 1.0` for a basket) — honest, not a fudge.
 *
 * Because the axis is the metric, the live-price marker, the ruler ticks and the
 * caption number are all the same scale — they physically cannot disagree, with
 * no clever window-fitting. Layout, from right to left:
 *   • **Liquidation line** — `m = 0`, at a FIXED position on every row (so rows
 *     stay comparable). Red liquidation zone runs from it to the right edge,
 *     covering a little way underwater (`AXIS_MIN_PCT`).
 *   • **Headroom** — neutral, from the live marker to the liquidation line: the
 *     distance the value can still fall. Zero once at / inside the zone.
 *   • **Collateral fill** — collateral-blue, from the left edge to the marker;
 *     its rounded cap is the live marker. The value/price is labelled alongside
 *     the bar, never on it.
 *   • **Ruler** — a "% from liquidation" axis: a gridline every 10%, labelled
 *     0–50% (`RULER_MAX_PCT`), evenly spaced, climbing leftward into the safe
 *     runway; the scale itself keeps running to `AXIS_MAX_PCT` past the last
 *     label, so a very safe position sits far left exactly where its % lands.
 *     Brightest at the liquidation line and fading as the runway lengthens.
 *     Revealed only on hover, and only on hover-capable (desktop) pointers —
 *     touch / mobile never shows it, so the resting readouts can't be crowded.
 *     The reveal waits a beat then fades up slowly.
 *
 * Underwater (value at / below the liquidation line, `m ≤ 0`) the runway is
 * spent, so the whole bar flips to the factual-liquidation red: lighter red for
 * the now-out-of-reach values above the line, the deep-red breach from the line
 * to the live marker, lighter red for any downside below it. The readouts drop
 * the headroom ruler and state "Liquidatable now" plus the rise needed to clear
 * the line (`recoverPct`, denominated in the live value).
 *
 * No safe/caution gradient (per the no-opinionated-colour principle): blue is a
 * structural collateral cue, red is the one factual liquidation colour, and the
 * numbers around the bar state the rest. Read-only — current oracle / chain state.

// The bar is built from distinct rounded segments laid directly on the card
// surface — not painted inside a recessed track (which read as the bars sinking
// into a dark well in dark mode). Three segments, separated by hairline gaps:
//   • FILL     — collateral-blue, left edge → live marker. Same structural
//                collateral colour as the tower chart: identity, not risk
//                valence (red stays the only valence colour).
//   • HEADROOM — neutral, live marker → liquidation line (how far it can fall).
//   • LIQ      — red liquidation zone, beyond the liquidation line.
// At this bar height every segment is fully pill-capped (`rounded-full`) on all
// four corners — a 10px-tall segment reads as rounded either way. The hairline
// gaps still draw the seams between segments.
const FILL = "bg-blue-500";
// Headroom is neutral but must stay legible on the dark card: rb-500 (the brand
// blue-grey) at low alpha lifts it to a clear but subordinate neutral that
// doesn't compete with the blue fill (plain rb-700 sat too close to the surface).

//     value can never fall *more* than 100%), so 100 is the natural cap — a
//     position that safe sits hard against the left edge.
//   • Right edge = AXIS_MIN_PCT: a little way underwater, so the red liquidation
//     zone has width and a freshly-liquidated position still shows its breach.
// The liquidation line (m = 0) therefore lands at AXIS_MAX_PCT / span of the way
// across — the SAME spot on every row, which is what keeps the rails comparable.
